Personal [Document Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_management_system) to store, label and search personal documents on a single computer. 

**Language: C#**

**Start: 2015**

## Why
I've been lost in hundreds of documents scattered in too many folders for years. I wanted a simple system that allowed me to store documents with labels (instead of archiving them in folders). I developed a [simple REPL in Python](https://github.com/mattbrepo/Dcm) first, but later I abandoned that project in favor of this GUI written in C#. 

## Example

Check the 'example' folder.
